DEPENDENCIES

This library requires Java 6 JDK, http://java.sun.com/

Building from source requires Leiningen, http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen


BUILDING

If you downloaded the library distribution as a .zip or .tar file,
everything is pre-built and there is nothing you need to do.

If you downloaded the sources from Git, then you need to run the build
with Leiningen. In the top-level directory of this project, run:

    lein jar

This compiles and builds the JAR file.


RUNNING THE EXAMPLES & TESTS

After building, copy the file from

    clojure-hadoop-${VERSION}.jar

to something short, like "examples.jar".  Each of the *.clj files in
the test/clojure_hadoop/examples directory contains instructions for
running that example.

The wordcount examples can also be run via the "lein test" command.


USING THE LIBRARY IN HADOOP

After building, include the "clojure-hadoop-${VERSION}.jar" file
in the lib/ directory of the JAR you submit as your Hadoop job.


DEPENDING ON THE LIBRARY WITH MAVEN

You can depend on clojure-hadoop in your Maven 2 projects by adding
the following lines to your pom.xml:

    <dependencies>
      ...

      <dependency>
        <groupId>clojure-hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>clojure-hadoop</artifactId>
        <version>${VERSION}</version>
      </dependency>

      ...
    </dependencies>
    ...
    <repositories>
      ...

      <repository>
        <id>clojars</id>
        <url> http://clojars.org/repo </url>
      </repository>

      ...
    </repositories>


USING THE LIBRARY

This library provides different layers of abstraction away from the
raw Hadoop API.

Layer 1: clojure-hadoop.imports

    Provides convenience functions for importing the many classes and
    interfaces in the Hadoop API.

Layer 2: clojure-hadoop.gen

    Provides gen-class macros to generate the multiple classes needed
    for a MapReduce job.  See the example file "wordcount1.clj" for a
    demonstration of these macros.

Layer 3: clojure-hadoop.wrap

    clojure-hadoop.wrap: provides wrapper functions that automatically
    convert between Hadoop Text objects and Clojure data structures.
    See the example file "wordcount2.clj" for a demonstration of these
    wrappers.

Layer 4: clojure-hadoop.job

    Provides a complete implementation of a Hadoop MapReduce job that
    can be dynamically configured to use any Clojure functions in the
    map and reduce phases.  See the example file "wordcount3.clj" for
    a demonstration of this usage.

Layer 5: clojure-hadoop.defjob

    A convenient macro to configure MapReduce jobs with Clojure code.
    See the example files "wordcount4.clj" and "wordcount5.clj" for
    demonstrations of this macro.
